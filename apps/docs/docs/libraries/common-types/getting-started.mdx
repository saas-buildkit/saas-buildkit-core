# Getting Started

---

The Common Types Library provides a set of general types and interfaces for the Softkit ecosystem, frequently used in auto-generated code to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy.

## Installation

To include the Common Types Library in your project, install it via yarn:

```bash
yarn add @softkit/common-types
```

## Basic Usage

The library includes a variety of types for general use across your applications. Below is a list of some key types and where to find more information on them:

### Standard Types

- [`SimpleResponseForCreatedEntityWithMessage`](/api/common-types/src/classes/SimpleResponseForCreatedEntityWithMessage): A response structure for newly created entities.
- [`IdParamUUID`](/api/common-types/src/classes/IdParamUUID): For validating UUID parameters in requests.
- [`VersionNumberParam`](/api/common-types/src/classes/VersionNumberParam): Validates version numbers as non-negative integers.

### Utility Types

- [`ExcludeKeys`](/api/common-types/src/type-aliases/ExcludeKeys): Excludes specified keys from a type.
- [`ExtractArrayMembers`](/api/common-types/src/type-aliases/ExtractArrayMembers): Extracts member types from array types.
- [`Maybe`](/api/common-types/src/type-aliases/Maybe): Represents a type that can be `undefined`.

These types are integral to DTOs, entity definitions, and other complex types, providing a consistent structure across your services.
