# Getting Started

The Mailgun Mail Module simplifies the process of integrating Mailgun's email services into your NestJS applications. It offers a streamlined approach to send emails, manage templates, and configure your email services with ease.

## Installation

To begin using the Mailgun Mail Module, you need to install the package and its dependencies in your project:

```bash
yarn add @softkit/mail
# For Mailgun, install the official mailgun.js package
yarn add mailgun.js@^9.3.0
```

## Basic Setup

Start by importing the `MailgunMailModule` into your NestJS application module:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MailgunMailModule } from '@softkit/mailgun-mail-module';

@Module({
  imports: [
    MailgunMailModule.forRoot({
      username: 'api',
      key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      domain: 'YOUR_DOMAIN',
      defaultFromEmail: 'noreply@example.com',
    }),
  ],
})
export class YourAppModule {}
```

Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_DOMAIN', and 'noreply@example.com' with your actual Mailgun API key, domain, and preferred sender email address.
