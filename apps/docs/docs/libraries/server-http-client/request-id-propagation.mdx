# Request ID Propagation

---

## Overview

The `server-http-client` library leverages NestJS's continuation-local storage (CLS) feature from [`nestjs-cls library`](https://papooch.github.io/nestjs-cls/) to ensure consistent logging and tracing across microservices.

## Continuation-Local Storage in NestJS

- NestJS's CLS provides a method to maintain request-specific data across asynchronous calls and callbacks.
- This feature is essential for tracking the context of each request in an application that operates on a microservices architecture.

## Request ID Propagation

- The library uses CLS to propagate request IDs from one service to another.
- This mechanism allows each request to carry its unique identifier, enhancing logging and monitoring capabilities.

## Enhancements in Debugging and Monitoring

- By preserving request IDs across different service calls, the library aids in debugging and understanding the flow of requests.
- This functionality is critical in microservices-based applications for maintaining traceability and accountability of requests.

## Seamless Integration

- The integration of request ID propagation with CLS in the `server-http-client` library is automatic and requires minimal configuration.
- Developers can benefit from this feature without the need for extensive setup or custom coding.

The use of CLS for request ID propagation is a significant aspect of the `server-http-client` library, contributing to the development of robust, maintainable, and traceable microservices applications.
