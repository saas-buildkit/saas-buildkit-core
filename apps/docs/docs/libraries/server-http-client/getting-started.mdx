## Overview

The [`server-http-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@softkit/server-http-client) library is an advanced HTTP client tailored for NestJS applications, designed to streamline communication with other NestJS services or any HTTP-based services.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Client Generation with Swagger**: Integrates with Swagger to automatically generate HTTP clients.
- **Axios Integration**: A wrapper over Axios, providing additional functionalities while working within the NestJS infrastructure.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Configurable retry mechanisms (linear, static, or exponential) for robust request handling.
- **Circuit Breaker**: A built-in circuit breaker mechanism with local memory cache for state management.
- **Exception Handling**: Converts exceptions to [`InternalProxyHttpException`](/api/server-http-client/src/classes/InternalProxyHttpException/) for simplified error handling between microservices.
- **Timeout Mechanism**: Configurable timeout settings to avoid prolonged waiting periods for server responses.
- **CLS Integration**: Utilizes `ClsService` for seamless propagation of auth tokens and request IDs between services. Read more about this in the [dedicated section on Request ID Propagation using CLS](/libraries/server-http-client/request-id-propagation)

## Installation

To get started, install the library using the following command:

```bash
yarn add @softkit/server-http-client
```

## Usage

### Creating an HTTP Client

Set up the HTTP client in your NestJS module:

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: 'AXIOS',
      useFactory: (cls: ClsService<UserClsStore<IAccessTokenPayload>>) => {
        return createAxiosInstance(cls, {
          url: 'http://localhost:54345',
          timeout: 1000,
          serviceName: 'sample',
        });
      },
      inject: [ClsService],
    },
  ],
  imports: [ClsModule],
})
export class YourAppModule {}
```

### Injecting and Using the Client

Inject and use the client in your controllers:

```typescript
@Controller('sample')
export class SampleController {
  constructor(@Inject('AXIOS') private readonly axios: AxiosInstance) {}
}
```
