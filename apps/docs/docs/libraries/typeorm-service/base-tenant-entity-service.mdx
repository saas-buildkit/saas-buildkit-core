# Base Tenant Entity Service

---

## Overview

`BaseTenantEntityService` specializes in handling multi-tenant scenarios, extending `BaseEntityService` to cater to applications managing data across multiple tenants.

### Key Features

- **Tenant-aware Operations**: Tailored to manage entities in a multi-tenant context.
- **Consistent Data Management**: Ensures secure and isolated handling of data for each tenant.
- **Inherited Robust Features**: Inherits all functionalities from `BaseEntityService`, including transactional operations and query capabilities.

Perfect for SaaS applications and systems requiring secure and isolated data management for different tenants.

# Usage

## Using Service with Generics

This service has an additional parameter in generics, after the repository type, used for excluding auto-generated types. This keeps the service type safe and avoids type errors.

Example:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class CustomUserRoleTenantService extends BaseTenantEntityService<
  CustomUserRole,
  CustomUserRoleTenantRepository,
  Pick<
    CustomUserRole,
    'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt' | 'deletedAt' | 'userId'
  >
> {
  constructor(repository: CustomUserRoleTenantRepository) {
    super(repository);
  }
}
```

This example excludes 5 fields from base methods and types, as they are populated by subscribers.
