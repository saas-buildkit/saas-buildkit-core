Unpack the comprehensive suite of features provided by the Test Utils library, designed to empower your testing with flexibility and precision.

## Database Testing Made Easy with `startPostgres`

The `startPostgres` function launches a Postgres database within a Docker container, fully equipped for testing. Customize your setup with a range of options or rely on the provided defaults for immediate startup.

### Configuration Options and Defaults

- **runMigrations**: Determines if migrations should run during setup. Default is `false`.
- **dbName**: Sets the database name, which is `'nest'` by default.
- **username & password**: Establishes the database credentials. Defaults are `'test-user'` and `'secret-test'`.
- **imageTag**: Selects the Postgres version. The default is `'15.4-alpine'`, providing a lightweight container.
- **setupTransactionsManagement**: Enables transactional context, set to `true` by default for robust data handling.
- **additionalTypeOrmModuleOptions**: Allows additional TypeORM configurations, which are empty by default for maximum compatibility.

With [`startPostgres`](/api/test-utils/src/functions/startPostgres/), you receive a [`StartedDb`](/api/test-utils/src/type-aliases/StartedDb/) object containing the container instance, TypeORM options, and a custom configuration service for TypeORM, providing a streamlined interface for your database tests.

## Local AWS Testing with `startLocalstack`

`startLocalstack` simulates an AWS environment on your local machine, configurable with a variety of services and settings:

- **imageName & imageTag**: Selects the LocalStack image to use, allowing you to test with different versions.
- **services**: A list of AWS services to include in your LocalStack, from S3 to DynamoDB, tailored to your testing needs.
- **ports**: Specifies which ports to expose, giving you control over service accessibility.

By calling [`startLocalstack`](/api/test-utils/src/functions/startLocalstack/), you receive a [`StartedLocalstack`](/api/test-utils/src/type-aliases/StartedLocalstack/) object, which includes the LocalStack container configuration and network settings, enabling immediate interaction with the emulated AWS services.

## Redis Server with `startRedis`

With `startRedis`, initiating a Redis server for testing is straightforward. It provides sensible defaults to get you started quickly, along with the flexibility to choose different versions as needed.

### Options and Defaults

- **imageName & imageTag**: Selects the Redis Docker image. By default, it uses `'redis:7.2.1-alpine3.18'`, combining the reliability of Redis with the efficiency of Alpine.

Calling [`startRedis`](/api/test-utils/src/functions/startRedis/) gives you a [`StartedRedis`](/api/test-utils/src/type-aliases/StartedRedis/) object, which includes both the Redis container and its connection details, simplifying the integration into your tests.
