## Employing SnakeNamingStrategy for Database Field Naming

In many NestJS applications, especially those interfacing with SQL databases, adopting a consistent and SQL-friendly naming convention for database fields is crucial. The `SnakeNamingStrategy`, a common approach in the NestJS ecosystem, offers a seamless way to handle field naming by converting typical JavaScript camelCase field names into snake_case. This strategy aligns well with the naming conventions often used in SQL databases.

### Advantages of SnakeNamingStrategy

- **SQL Compatibility**: Snake case (`field_name`) is widely used in SQL databases, making `SnakeNamingStrategy` a natural fit for developers.
- **Consistency**: Provides a uniform naming convention across the database, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Avoiding Ambiguities**: By not relying on asterisks (\*) for field selection in SQL queries, it reduces the risk of selecting unintended fields, especially in complex queries.

### Implementing SnakeNamingStrategy

When setting up your NestJS project, you can configure TypeORM to use `SnakeNamingStrategy` for all database fields. This ensures that all your entity field names are automatically converted to snake case when interacting with the database.

Hereâ€™s a simple illustration:

```javascript
import { SnakeNamingStrategy } from 'typeorm-naming-strategies';

// In your TypeORM configuration
@Allow()
namingStrategy: NamingStrategyInterface = new SnakeNamingStrategy();
```

In this setup, fields like `tenantId` or `createdAt` in your entities would be represented as `tenant_id` and `created_at` in your database tables, respectively.

### Practical Example

Consider a scenario where you have a `Tenant` entity with a `tenantId` field. Using `SnakeNamingStrategy`, you can confidently write SQL queries like:

```sql
SELECT tenant_id FROM tenants;
```

This approach is more explicit and clear compared to using `SELECT *`, ensuring that only the required fields are fetched and reducing the likelihood of errors in data retrieval.

### Conclusion

The `SnakeNamingStrategy` offers a streamlined and effective solution for field naming in SQL databases, enhancing the synergy between your NestJS application and the database. For a cohesive development experience, consider adopting this strategy in your projects.
