# Features

---

This ESLint configuration comes with a comprehensive set of plugins and rules designed to enhance security, improve performance, and enforce best coding practices for any JavaScript or TypeScript project.

## Default Plugins

The configuration includes the following ESLint plugins:

- `@nx`
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- `simple-import-sort`
- `security`
- `sonarjs`
- `jest`
- `unicorn`
- `promise`
- `unused-imports`

## Predefined Rules

A set of rules have been established to guide code quality and consistency:

- Unused imports and variables are flagged as errors or warnings.
- Enforces module boundaries as per Nx workspace constraints.
- Extends various recommended rules from the ESLint community.
- Overrides for specific file patterns, including TypeScript and JavaScript files.
- Customized rules for Jest test files to accommodate testing patterns.

## Environment Configuration

The ESLint configuration is set up to support the following environments:

- `node`: Indicates that the code runs in a Node.js environment.
- `jest`: Enables Jest testing environment.
- `jest/globals`: Includes Jest's global variables.
- `es2021`: Ensures compatibility with ECMAScript 2021 features.

These environment settings ensure that the linter understands the context in which your code runs, applying the most relevant rules and globals.

## Extending the Configuration

While the ESLint Backend library provides a robust set of linting rules, you might want to extend or customize the configuration to fit your project's specific needs.

### Creating a Custom Configuration

Here's how you can create your own ESLint configuration based on the ESLint Backend library:

1. **Install the Base Configuration**:
   Begin by adding the ESLint Backend configuration to your project:

   ```bash
   yarn add -D @softkit/eslint-config
   ```

2. **Create a Custom ESLint File**:
   In your project's root, create an `.eslintrc.js` or `.eslintrc.json` file.

3. **Extend the Base Configuration**:
   Use the `extends` property to build upon the provided configuration:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     extends: ['./node_modules/@softkit/eslint-backend/src/index.js'],
     rules: {
       // Override or add additional rules here
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Override or Add Rules**:
   You can customize the rules as needed to enforce your own coding standards.

### Integration with IDEs

For a seamless development experience, integrate your ESLint configuration with your preferred IDE. This provides real-time linting and code quality checks while you write code.

### Use in Continuous Integration

To ensure consistent code quality, include ESLint checks in your continuous integration (CI) pipeline. This will automatically enforce your coding standards on every commit or pull request.

## Conclusion

By adopting this ESLint configuration, your project benefits from a robust and well-considered set of linting rules and practices. Whether you're maintaining a large codebase or starting a new project, these settings will help ensure your code remains clean, efficient, and aligned with industry standards.
