# Transforms & Custom Decorators

---

## Overview

The Validation Library includes a set of transforms and custom decorators that provide additional functionality over the base class-validator features.

### Custom Transforms

The library offers custom transforms that allow for more nuanced type coercion and value transformation.

#### Example Transform Usage

```typescript
import { Transform } from 'class-transformer';
import { trim } from '@softkit/validation';

export class CreateUserDto {
  @Transform(trim)
  name: string;
}
```

### Custom Decorators

Enhance validation with custom decorators for more specific use-cases, such as localized email validation and matching field checks.

When creating a sign-up form, it's crucial to validate that the user has entered the intended password correctly. This often involves having a "repeat password" field. The Validation Library provides decorators to ensure the repeated password matches the original password.

#### Custom Decorator Example

```typescript
import { IsEmailLocalized, Match } from '@softkit/validation';

export class UserDto {
  @IsEmailLocalized()
  email: string;

  @PasswordLocalized()
  @IsStringCombinedLocalized({
    minLength: 8,
    maxLength: 256,
  })
  password: string;

  @PasswordLocalized()
  @MatchesWithProperty('password', {
    message: 'validation.REPEAT_PASSWORD_DOESNT_MATCH',
  })
  repeatedPassword: string;
}
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging the Validation Library, your application gains a powerful suite of tools to ensure robust data validation. The additional transforms and decorators enhance the standard class-validator functionality, making your validation logic more concise and maintainable.
