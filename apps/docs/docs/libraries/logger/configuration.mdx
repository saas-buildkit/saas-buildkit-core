# Configuration

---

## Default Configuration

- **LoggingInterceptor**: Logs all incoming requests.
- **Default Logger Configuration**: Logs finish request with request ID and time, and all exceptions with stack trace.

## Advanced Configuration

Customize the logger with various configuration options:

- **colorize**: Toggles colorized logs. Default is `true`.
- **level**: Sets the logging level. Default is `info`.
- **prettyPrint**: Enables pretty printing of logs. Useful for development. Default is `true`.

### Example of Logged Requests

When an incoming request is processed, the Logger Library logs details such as the method, URL, and request parameters. For instance, a GET request to `/api/user` might be logged as:

```
[16:00:00.477] INFO (YourAppModule): Call Endpoint: GET /api/user Params: {}
```

Upon successful completion, it logs the request's finish time and the request ID:

```
[16:00:00.477] INFO (YourAppModule): Finished Endpoint: GET /api/user for 500ms ReqId: 12345
```

In case of an error, it logs the error message and stack trace:

```
[16:00:00.477] ERROR (YourAppModule): Failed Endpoint: GET /api/user Error - Resource not found.
```

## Conclusion

Integrating the Logger Library into your NestJS project streamlines logging setup and provides robust, configurable logging solutions tailored to modern application needs.
