## Failing Fast

- Ensures immediate detection of configuration errors at startup, leading to more reliable and maintainable applications.

## Configuration Checking

- Facilitates validation and verification of configuration values, ensuring that they meet the application's requirements.

## Independent Configuration Injection

- Allows for flexible and decoupled configuration management by enabling the injection of configurations independently across different modules.

## Variable Substitutions

- Follows the [nestjs-config's variable substitutions](https://github.com/Nikaple/nest-typed-config?tab=readme-ov-file#uses-of-variable-substitutions). Use environment variables and default values in configuration files. Reference other variables within the same configuration for dynamic settings.

## Profiles

- Supports environment-specific configurations through profiles.
- Utilizes the `NESTJS_PROFILES` environment variable to determine the active profile(s).
- Enables merging configurations from multiple profiles, resolving conflicts based on the specified order.
- Simplifies testing by setting a test profile in `jest.preset.js`.

Example `jest.preset.js`:

```javascript
process.env.NESTJS_PROFILES = 'test';
module.exports = { testEnvironment: 'node' };
```
